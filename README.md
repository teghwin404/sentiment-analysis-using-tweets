## Sentiment Analysis of Fast Fashion Brands using Twitter Data
Using company and user tweets, running a sentiment analysis about fast fashion brands' sustainability practices. The project aims to understand the consumer sentiment about a brand's sustainability practices and if a brand can use social media as a tool to gauge user sentiment in the context of environmental practices. For this analysis we chose to analyze the top fast fashion brands in Canada; H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, and SHEIN. To act as a comparative metric, we included Patagonia to the list, a brand built on sustainable values.

There are two key sources of tweets that we scraped for this project using the Twitter API. 
1. Tweets posted by fast fashion companies
2. Tweets made by users mentioning these companies in a sustainability context

The first part of the project focuses on understanding the current positioning of our selected brands in terms of their Twitter activity and user sentiment. By comparing across brands, we will quantify the extent to which firms are involved in sustainability efforts on their media platforms and highlight the resulting current perception of Twitter users on these efforts.

Secondly, the project examines the drivers of user sentiment about a brand’s sustainability practices. A brand’s sentiment overtime is investigated overtime to identify reasons for specific spikes and dips facilated by external research.

The final section includes an analysis about the effectiveness of Twitter as a corrective action (or medium of speech) to address sustainability concerns about brands. This analysis uses vizualization techniques to identify patterns between tweets by the brand along with the user tweets about the brands’ sustainability practices. 

The analysis yields decent evidence indicating that tweets can indeed be used as corrective action, even if it’s for short-term benefit. However, as observed in the study, if the tweets are not backed by clear effort or action, then the mitigation efforts could easily backfire. Firms must not take the risk of “greenwashing” lightly.
